## About Me

Hi, I'm Haseeb Haider, a **passionate full-stack web developer** with a love for building scalable, user-friendly applications. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy working on projects that solve real-world problems. I'm constantly learning and exploring new tools and frameworks to stay updated with the latest industry trends.  
When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge with the developer community.
